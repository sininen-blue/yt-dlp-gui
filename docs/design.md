## process

(background) when you start the program, it checks your current version of yt-dlp against the latest version of yt-dlp
- download has a warning if this check has not been finished
- if true, proceed as normal
- if false, add a yellow warning to the log


when you enter a link, it checks all the available options
1. This would gray out the options bar until finished
2. then the optionts section would have all the drop downs filled with data, with some data having warkings. Like formats that need re-encoding

You can't download while these options are loading

Then if you change a bunch of settings, you can save that as a profile/preset you can use whenever you next send a link
